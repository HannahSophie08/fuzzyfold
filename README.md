# Vienna Nucleic Acid Suite

A collection of traditional ViennaRNA algorithms for nucleic acid thermodynamics and kinetics.

Current focus:
 - single-stranded nucleic acid folding (Kinfold)
 - cotranscriptional folding 
 - cotranscriptional folding visualization.
 - domain-level reaction network enumeration.
